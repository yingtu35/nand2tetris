# nand2tetris
This nand2tetris repository include several projects that comes from the course 
called "Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris".
Information of this course could be found in this link:
https://www.nand2tetris.org/

I will briefly introduce these projects below. Feel free to browse through these projects for more information.

## Hack Assembler
This is a assembler program written in JAVA that translates Hack assembly code into executable Hack binary code.

## VM Translator
This is a program that translates the intermediate Hack VM code into the assembly code. 

## Jack Analyzer
This is a syntax analyzer that parse the Jack program source code and output a XML file representing the parse tree.

## Jack Compiler
This is a program that extends the Jack Analyzer to a full-blown compiler.
It translates the Jack program source code into the Hack VM code. 

## Operating System
This is a simplified OS that provides some useful classes that bridges the gap between high-level programming languages and low-level machine code.

# Notes
If you are taking the course and yet to finish this project, I strongly suggest
you do not copy the codes into your project.
Not only is it against the rules specified by the course, but you will also miss the opportunity
to learn by doing it yourself!
