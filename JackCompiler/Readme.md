# JackCompiler

## Description
JackCompiler is a compiler for Jack language, project 11 of a Nand2Tetris course.
JackCompiler compiles any given "error free" Jack files and produce VM codes.

## How to use it
1. Download the source files in the src folder
2. Compile JackCompiler.java (e.g. type "javac JackCompiler.java" in Command Prompt)
3. Compile code files written in Jack by one of the following ways:
	1. provide a file path to the JackCompiler, it will compile the file and output a VM file
	2. You can also provide a directory to the JackCompiler, it will recognize all the Jack files in the directory, and produce VM files in the directory.
4. To inspect the produced VM files, you can use the VMEmulator (provided at Nand2Tetris website) to run the VM files

## Notes
If you are taking the course and yet to finish this project, I strongly suggest
you do not copy the codes into your project.
Not only is it against the rules specified by the course, but you will also miss the opportunity
to realize the beauty of the compiler!

Do the project by your own!
