## How to Play
Don't Touch the Wall has 3 levels. In each level, the goal is to go from the starting position and reach the end of the map.
As you are playing, you can use press Up, Down, Left, Right to control the player.
As the name of the game suggests, if the player slightly touches the wall, it's game over, and you'll have to restart the level.

The game also has a timer shown on the side of the game. You have to get to the finish before time runs out.

If you find it hard to pass the game, maybe you can check the source file for some hidden features to help you!
